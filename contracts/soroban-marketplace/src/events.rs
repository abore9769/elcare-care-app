// events.rs — Defines all contract event schemas for ELCARE-HUB Marketplace
//
// ── Event Schema Versioning Policy (Issue #278) ─────────────────────────────
//
// The indexer (`indexer/src/event-schemas.ts`) decodes these events from raw
// Soroban XDR using a per-event-type schema registry. The indexer is deployed
// and upgraded independently from these contracts, and must remain able to
// decode historical ledger events forever (raw XDR is replayable via
// `indexer/src/backfill.ts`). That cross-component dependency is why event
// shape changes follow explicit rules rather than being made ad hoc:
//
// 1. Numbering: `EVENT_SCHEMA_VERSION` below applies to the settlement- and
//    audit-critical event structs that carry an explicit `schema_version:
//    u32` field (see the list in `docs/guides/event-parsing.md`). Bump it
//    whenever any of those structs gains a new field. Historical events
//    emitted before the field existed have no `schema_version` in their XDR
//    at all — the indexer treats that absence as implicit version 0.
// 2. Additive-only: existing fields are never renamed, retyped, removed, or
//    given a different meaning. A shape change is always a NEW field
//    appended to the struct. Soroban encodes `#[contracttype]` structs as an
//    ordered map keyed by field name, so appending a field never changes how
//    existing fields decode.
// 3. Numeric encoding is fixed per field once chosen: prices/amounts are
//    `i128`, ledger sequences are `u32`, ids/timestamps are `u64`. Never
//    narrow or widen an existing field's numeric type — add a new field
//    instead of changing one in place.
// 4. Topic naming: topic constants (e.g. `ARTWORK_SOLD`) are permanent once
//    shipped. A new event kind gets a new topic constant; an existing topic
//    is never reused for a differently-shaped payload.
// 5. Deprecation: old struct fields are never mutated or deleted while any
//    historical ledger data referencing them may still need to be replayed.
//    Mark superseded fields as deprecated in a doc comment only.
// 6. Migration for historical records: because the indexer persists decoded
//    JSON and can always fall back to raw XDR, a shape change never requires
//    rewriting historical rows. Instead, the indexer's schema field for the
//    new struct field MUST be marked `optional: true` in `SCHEMA_REGISTRY`
//    (see `indexer/src/event-schemas.ts`) so both pre- and post-bump events
//    decode through the same code path. Full migration guidance and the
//    per-event version catalog live in `docs/guides/event-parsing.md`.
